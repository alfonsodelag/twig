# Twig
Twig is a modern template engine designed for PHP that is friendly for both the designer and the developer. It is a very good alternative to the PHPTemplate way of building the presentation logic of a web application, since it represents a much cleaner template experience.

Twig uses a very easy to understand syntax and a framework that separates the rendering logic from the business logic. This detail is really important to maintain and optimally develop a professional platform.
